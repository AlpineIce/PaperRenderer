# PaperRenderer
PaperRenderer is a work in progress personal project created to develop Vulkan abstraction centered around mesh rendering, including ray tracing and traditional render passes. The main features include buffers, images/textures, allocations, compute shaders, materials, models (including LODs), unique "render passes" which model instances and material instances can be assigned to, and incomplete acceleration structures and ray tracing.

This project isn't complete and should therefore be assumed to be changed at any moment as I come up with better abstractions and figure out which ones aren't optimal.

I will add an example and build instructions in the future when I reach a point where I'm satisfied with where things are
