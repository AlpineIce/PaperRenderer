# PaperRenderer
PaperRenderer is a work in progress personal project which aims to be a Vulkan abstraction centered around mesh rendering with support for ray tracing and traditional rasterization. Materials for both types of rendering are supported, with 2 levels of them existing for rasterization (Material, Material Instance; comparable to how UE materials would be setup). Models act as a blueprint for any instances, and materials (instances in the case of raster) can be assigned for each instance per render pass (raster or RT). A compute shader abstraction also exists to make compute shader setup relatively easy, and so do all the resource types (Buffers, Images) that would be useful in them. The renderer also uses Vulkan in it's API, so any functionality that doesn't already exist can be implemented with vulkan by itself.

This project isn't complete and should therefore be assumed to be changed at any moment as I come up with better abstractions and figure out which ones aren't optimal. There are many features I would like to add in the future, but I don't have unlimited time to work on this and is therefore usually reserved for weekends. The end goal of this project isn't to necessarily meet any specification, but to see how good of a renderer I can make with time. With that being said, I will add an example and build instructions in the future when I reach a point where I'm satisfied enough with where things are, but that point hasn't necessarily been reached yet.
