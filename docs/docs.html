                <p>
                    Paper Renderer is a collection of GPU driven abstractions for rendering with ray tracing and rasterization. It aims to not abstract too much away, but still be powerful 
                    enough that the abstractions are worth using and could significantly speed up development of a higher level renderer abstraction. The GPU driven nature of these abstractions 
                    means that static scenes use next to no CPU time, even for tens of thousands of objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the most useful abstractions include simplifying a render pass down to specifying a model instance, its material (and parameters through a material instance like UE), 
                    and the attachments used. A very similar abstraction is used for ray tracing too, but parameters must be manually setup in your shaders, since ray tracing pipelines can only 
                    be bound once per "pass". Models all have their own collection of LODs (technically optional) and can be instantiated and with their own unique transformations. Compute shaders 
                    have a basic wrapper where you can specify its descriptors and shader. The abstractions mentioned aren't the only things that exist, and more will be mentioned further in 
                    the documentation.
                </p>

                    Paper Renderer should work on both Windows and Linux as long as the graphics drivers are updated to the latest versions. Updating the drivers is very important since 
                    development of this doesn't conform to any minimum version and expects people to be using up-to-date drivers unless otherwise specified. With that being said, development occurs 
                    on Linux, so if the code doesn't compile on Windows, it's a genuine mistake and an posting an issue or PR fixing it would be appreciated. <strong>If your goal is to target as 
                    much hardware as possible, this library probably isn't right for you. Any requests to "dumb" down features for supporting architecture that is years old at the cost of complexity 
                    and worse performance (e.g. CPU culling) will likely be ignored (sorry).</strong>
